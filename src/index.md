My name is Eduardo Furlan and I am a PhD student at the [National Institute for Space Research](https://www.gov.br/inpe/pt-br/area-conhecimento/posgraduacao) (INPE), in the [Postgraduate Program in Applied Computing](https://www.gov.br/inpe/pt-br/area-conhecimento/posgraduacao/cap) (CAP). My research field is High Performance Computing (HPC), advised by [Stephan Stephany](http://www.lac.inpe.br/~stephan/) and [Roberto Souto](https://www.lncc.br/colaborador/Roberto_Pinto_Souto). I received my MSc in Applied Computing from INPE in 2022. The focus of my research is the solution of advanced scientific and engineering problems using [HPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing). I also teach undergraduate courses, and I have 15+ years of experience in the industrial engineering field.

## Teaching

I teach undergraduate classes in [engineering and computing courses](teaching.md), where I try to conduct classes in order to bring reflections on the practical experience of the profession, working on the relationship between the professional and academic performance of the student, stimulating critical thinking based on specialized literature, and encouraging the production of knowledge.

## Industrial experience

I have 15+ years of experience in the packaging, machinery, automotive, and engineering design sectors. I worked in the areas of production and final assembly in the automotive industry, manufacturing of industrial machinery and equipment, and industrial engineering in the packaging industry.
