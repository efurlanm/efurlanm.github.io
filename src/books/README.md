# Books

Selected books, ebooks, wikibooks, papers, publications, and related topics that I collect over time. Includes some documents that I have edited.

* Setzer, V. W. (1988). *Sistema simples para documentação semi-automática de programas*. <https://repositorio.usp.br/item/000781431> (in Portuguese) (this article is publicly available) [[PDF](autodoc/autodoc.pdf)] [[HTML](autodoc/autodoc.md)]. Notes: the PDF document was created using ScanTailor, OCRmyPDF, and Master PDF Editor 4. The HTML document was made by manually editing the text file generated by OCR.
* Setzer, V. W., & Melo, I. S. H. de. (1989). *A Construção de Um Compilador*. <https://www.ime.usp.br/~vwsetzer> (in Portuguese) [[PDF](bcomp/A_Construcao_de_um_Compilador_(r1.2b)-Setzer.pdf)] [[Notes](bcomp/bcomp.md)]
* Pinto, T. T. S. (2014). *GGLL: a parser generator for LL(1) graphical grammars*. University of Sao Paulo. DOI 10.11606/D.45.2014.tde-23012015-075452. <http://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/45/45134/tde-23012015-075452/>
* [Threaded Interpretive Languages: Their Design and Implementation](https://vdoc.pub/documents/threaded-interpretive-languages-their-design-and-implementation-1seph9gct7uo), by RG Loeliger - explores the principles and architecture of [threaded interpretive languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threaded_code), with a specific focus on Forth-like languages. 
* [Threaded code designs for Forth interpreters](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/146559.146561), by PJ Hong - techniques for implementing threaded code in Forth interpreters.
* [Library](https://vdoc.pub/search/compiler) with several books on compilers, computers, and programming.


## Wikibooks

* [Compiler](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Software_Engineering/Tools/Compiler) - from the book *Introduction to Software Engineering*. Overview of compilers, explaining how they transform source code written in a high-level programming language into machine code or another lower-level language.
* [Compiler Construction](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Compiler_Construction) - provides a detailed guide on the theory and practice of compiler construction, including lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation.


## Revision numbers

The documents I edit have revision numbers in the filename, to facilitate identification and handling. The numbering rules are based on [[Scriptorium (2018)](https://www.epublibre.org/libro/detalle/2398)].

* The revision number is always changed when any change is made to the document, including its name.
* The initial revision number when creating the document for the first time will be `r1.0` .
* The following numbers will be renamed by increasing one decimal place (r1.1, r1.2, r1.3, ...).
* When r1.9 is reached, the next number will be r2.0.
* In case of a radical change (addition of illustrations, notes and similar situations), it is allowed to jump directly to the next
integer number (e.g.: from r1.4 to r2.0).
* In cases where the content of the document does not change, but is only compacted, or some other external change, the number will have an "a" added to the end: r1.0a, r1.1a, ...


## LaTeX

* Example of how to generate [PDF/A-3u](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF/A) using LaTeX and LuaTeX. [[.tex](latex/pdfa3u-min-ex.tex)] [[.pdf](latex/pdfa3u-min-ex.pdf)]
    * Passes validation test: <https://xodo.com/validate-pdfa> and <https://demo.verapdf.org/>
* Example of how to generate [PDF 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) using LaTeX and LuaTeX. [[.tex](latex/pdf2.0-min-ex.tex)] [[.pdf](latex/pdf2.0-min-ex.pdf)]
    * Passes validation test: <https://www.pdf-online.com/osa/validate.aspx>
