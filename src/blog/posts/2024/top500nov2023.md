Rank | System | Cores | Rmax (PFlop/s) | Rpeak (PFlop/s) | Power (kW)
---|---|---|---|---|---
462 | Santos Dumont (SDumont) - Bull Sequana X1000, Xeon Gold 6252 24C 2.1GHz, Mellanox InfiniBand EDR, NVIDIA Tesla V100 SXM2, EVIDEN Laboratório Nacional de Computação Científica Brazil | 33,856 | 1.85 | 2.73 |


[SDumont][1] is a Brazilian public supercomputer dedicated to teaching and research, and is the main machine of [SINAPAD][2]. The manufacturer is the French company [Atos/Bull][3] and has an installed processing capacity of around [5.1 petaflops peak][4], divided into [8 partitions][5]: 4 partitions with CPU, 3 partitions with CPU + GPU, and 1 partition with CPU + Xeon Phi. SDumont should be in the TOP 500 with this capacity, but because it is partitioned, it can only run [Linpack Benchmark][6] on a single partition, only this being [taken into consideration][7] by the TOP500. A [new upgrade is planned for 2024][8], boosting its capacity to 23 petaflops.
