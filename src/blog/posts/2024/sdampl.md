# LNCC SDumont supercomputer upgrade

The National Scientific Computing Laboratory (LNCC) and Eviden/Atos signed a new contract worth us$ 19.4 million, which will allow the machine to go from the current 5.1 Petaflop/s to 17 Petaflop/s of capacity. The technology will be based on the BullSequana XH3000 architecture, and with the expansion it will be the most powerful supercomputer in Latin America dedicated to academic studies.
