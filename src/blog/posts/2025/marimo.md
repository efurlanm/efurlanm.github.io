Interesting alternative to Jupyter Notebook, but with other goals and features. The idea is to embed everything inside a single .py file, instead of an .ipynb file. The .py file is used both for the graphical interface (interactive web app) and for command line execution. It tries to eliminate some of Jupyter's reproducibility issues. It has features such as integration with package and project managers, such as [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv). It's worth checking out.
