## Works

This section includes some of the work I have completed for my own use, for postgraduate coursework, and for my classes. The [research](research.md) page contains works pertaining to my research activity. The following items are not ordered.

- [PD1B24](https://github.com/efurlanm/pd1b24/) - repository containing code, data, manuscripts, and other files used in my research on PIML for the Qualifying and Proposal Exams.

- [MSC22](https://github.com/efurlanm/msc22/) - repository containing the material generated during my master's research.

- [PINN Discovery](https://github.com/efurlanm/425/tree/main/project/) - repository containing my work on data-driven parameter discovery of a 1D Burgers' equation using a physics-informed neural network. There is also an [online HTML version of the manuscript](https://efurlanm.github.io/425/).

- [PINN GQM](https://github.com/efurlanm/421/tree/main/project/) - repository containing my work related to solving the Burgers' equation using two methods, physics-informed neural network and Gaussian quadrature. There is also an [online HTML version of the manuscript](https://efurlanm.github.io/421/).

- [Stencil](https://github.com/efurlanm/bs21/) - comparison of high-performance computing approaches in the Python environment for a five-point Stencil test problem. There is also an [online HTML version of the manuscript](https://efurlanm.github.io/bs21/).

- [TAMA21](https://github.com/efurlanm/tama21/) - repository containing a work developed for presentations in courses, on examples of HPC approaches in a Python environment for a 5-point stencil testing problem, executed on the Santos Dumont supercomputer and also on Google Colab.

- [ML](https://github.com/efurlanm/ml/) - repository containing my personal notes on Machine Learning and related topics.

- [CNN & MLP](https://github.com/efurlanm/351/) - repository containing my notes on the CAP 351 course, and also the manuscript generated from the work, entitled "Comparison of CNN and MLP artificial neural network models, for an optical character recognition test case" (in Portuguese).

- [Home](https://github.com/efurlanm/home/) - repository dedicated to my personal notes on High Performance Computing, Parallel Processing, Programming Languages, and related topics.
