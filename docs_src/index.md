![](assets/img/avatar-200x150.jpg)

I am a PhD student at the [National Institute for Space Research](https://www.gov.br/inpe/pt-br/area-conhecimento/posgraduacao) (INPE), within the [Postgraduate Program in Applied Computing](https://www.gov.br/inpe/pt-br/area-conhecimento/posgraduacao/cap) (CAP). My research field is High Performance Computing (HPC), advised by [Stephan Stephany](http://www.lac.inpe.br/~stephan/) and [Roberto Souto](https://www.lncc.br/colaborador/Roberto_Pinto_Souto), focusing on the solution of advanced scientific and engineering problems. I earned my MSc in Applied Computing from INPE in 2022, and I also teach undergraduate courses, bringing extensive experience from the industrial engineering field.

## Research interests

* New technologies and methods applied in HPC.
* Solution of scientific and engineering problems using HPC.

## Projects

* **PIML** - application of physics-based machine learning in solving scientific problems.
* **MPI-based HPC Approaches** - use of recent high-performance computing resources in solving scientific problems.

More information can be found on the [research page](research.md).

## Teaching

I teach undergraduate classes in [engineering and computing courses](teaching.md), where I try to conduct classes in order to bring reflections on the practical experience of the profession, working on the relationship between the professional and academic performance of the student, stimulating critical thinking based on specialized literature, and encouraging the production of knowledge.

## Industrial experience

I have 15+ years of experience in the packaging, machinery, automotive, and engineering design sectors. I worked in the areas of production and final assembly in the automotive industry, manufacturing of industrial machinery and equipment, and industrial engineering in the packaging industry.
