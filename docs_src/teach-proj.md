# Autonomous Line-Following Robot

As an integral component of my project-based learning methodology, consistently applied across all disciplines I teach each semester, I proposed and guided the development of an autonomous line-following robot. This comprehensive project involved students in the design, hardware integration, software programming, and control system optimization, culminating in a robotics competition where the robot's ability to autonomously navigate complex tracks was rigorously tested. The valuable insights gained from this development and competitive analysis were further documented in a scientific paper, highlighting the technical challenges, innovative solutions, and the robot's practical application and efficiency.

This gallery documents an interdisciplinary, hands-on learning initiative where students designed, built, and programmed line-following robots for a competition that I proposed. This activity fostered collaborative teamwork and the application of a structured methodology, integrating concepts and skills from diverse curriculum disciplines. Through this process, students gained practical experience and developed real-world problem-solving skills. The project culminated in a competitive event showcasing their work. As part of the project documentation and an introduction to academic publishing, students also produced a brief introductory article summarizing their approach and outcomes. Some past publications are listed in [pub-courses](pub-courses.md).
