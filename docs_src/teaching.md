## Publications

* [Course publications](pub-courses.md) - publications that were generated as part of the activities of the courses taught.
* [All Publications ](pub-all.md) (long listing) - collection of all publications, including courses, teaching material, and my research.

## Student Projects

* [Autonomous line-following robot](teach-proj.md) - as a cornerstone of my project-based learning methodology across all courses, this initiative focuses on the development and competitive evaluation of an autonomous robot. This hands-on project integrates hardware, software, and control systems, culminating in a robotics competition and a scientific publication detailing its design and performance.
