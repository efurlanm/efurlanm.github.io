# HP-41

The 1979 HP-41 series programmable calculator, produced until 1990, was famously used in the Space Shuttle missions. It featured an LCD alphanumeric display and was powered by a processor initially called "Coconut" (or 1LE3 CPU), later more broadly known as the Nut CPU. The calculator included RAM, ROM, and I/O capabilities, utilizing the interpreted programming language FOCAL ("Forty One Calculator Language"). Both the operating system and the interpreter were stored in ROM, programmed using the Coconut processor's assembly language, also called MCODE (or "M-Code"). A later upgrade, the NEWT Microprocessor, further enhanced its capabilities.

What truly sets this calculator apart are its hardware expansion slots. These allowed users to significantly expand its functionality by adding various components such as memory modules, printer interfaces, card readers, barcode wands, and specialized application modules. This innovative design was a clear precursor to the expansion slots found in modern computers. The HP-41 also famously utilized Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) for its input logic.

While it naturally lacked the processing power and versatility of modern portable computing devices, the HP-41's design philosophy—rooted in portability and user customization—profoundly influenced the development of more advanced mobile computing equipment. The HP-41C, for instance, was a popular model in the series, recognized for its "Continuous Memory" feature.
