# Zenodo

Zenodo is a general-purpose open repository developed under the European OpenAIRE program and operated by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) and allows the deposit of research articles, datasets, research software, reports and any other related digital artifacts to research. For each submission, a persistent digital object identifier (DOI) is created, which makes stored items easily citable. It also allows the deposit of data sets of up to 50 GB. One supported source is GitHub repositories. It is hosted on CERN's high-performance computing infrastructure that is operated primarily for the needs of high-energy physics.
