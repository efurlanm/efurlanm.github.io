# Zotero

I use [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) in my daily life to do my research. Zotero is a free and open source reference manager for bibliographic data and research materials. It features integration with web browsers, word processors, Google Docs, generation of in-text citations, footnotes and bibliographies, and has a built-in PDF reader with annotation capabilities. It was originally created at the [Center for History and New Media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_History_and_New_Media) at [George Mason University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Mason_University).
